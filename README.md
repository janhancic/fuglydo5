# FuglyDo5

## What is it?
This is the source code of my entry for the 10K Apart Challange. You can read more about my entry and the contest [here](http://hancic.info/10k-apart-challenge "FulgyDo5 and 10K Apart challenge"). Here is the uncompressed code, but do mind that I was working in under the 10K file size limit, so the code isn't exactly pretty.

## How to use it?
If you wish to use it, just put all three files (index.html, script.js & style.css) into the same folder on your server (or computer) and open index.html. That's it, all the magic happens in the browser.
