# FuglyDo5

## What is it?
This is the (slightly modified) source code of my entry for the 10K Apart Challenge. You can read more about my entry and the contest [here](http://hancic.info/10k-apart-challenge "FulgyDo5 and 10K Apart challenge"). Here is the uncompressed code, but do mind that I was working in under the 10K file size limit, so the code isn't exactly pretty.

## How to use it?
If you wish to use it, just put all three files (`index.html`, `script.js` & `style.css`) into the same folder on your server (or computer) and open index.html. That's it, all the magic happens in the browser.

## Status
This project was originally done in 2010 under the constraint of code being less than 10K in size. As such the code is not the best shining example of JavaScript. Treat it as such :)
